### Greetings

My name is William Ellison.  I'm a data scientist and NLP programmer in training who is located in the American Southeast.  I'm currently working outside the technical professions in a medical billing office.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on relearning my Python skills and building some projects.  I'm looking to combine my interests in linguistics, statistics, computer science, and healthcare by processing medical records using NLP.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (scikit-learn, NLTK, NumPy, Pandas, etc.) and R.  I'm studying data science through MOOCs sponsored by Johns Hopkins University and the University of Michigan.  Additionally, I'm studying linguistics on my own and learning math through Khan Academy and a MOOC sponsored by <abbr title="University of Colorado">CU</abbr> Boulder.

- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach out to me on LinkedIn, X, and Instagram using the links in my profile.

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his (English); il/lui (français); él/ello (español); 他（中文）; 彼（日本語）; on/jego (polski).

- ⚡ Fun fact: I speak four foreign languages to various degrees of fluency: French, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese.  At the time of writing, I'm going to be starting my study of Polish soon.  Additionally, I'm a keen conlanger, and some of my conlang projects will end up with repositories here.
